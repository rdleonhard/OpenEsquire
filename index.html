                    providing guidance on compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and representing
                    clients in

                <h2>Code is Law</h2>
                <p>The rules governing Ethereum transactions are encoded in the form of smart contracts, which
                    are
                    self-executing pieces of code. This allows for the creation of transparent and immutable
                    contracts
                    that can be automatically enforced. This means that the terms of a contract cannot be
                    changed or
                    altered once they have been agreed upon, ensuring that all parties involved in a transaction
                    can
                    have confidence in the fairness and reliability of the system.</p>

                <p>The use of smart contracts also allows for the automation of complex transactions and
                    business logic,
                    making it possible to execute complex agreements without the need for intermediaries or
                    other third
                    parties. This can greatly reduce the costs and friction associated with traditional legal
                    contracts,
                    making it easier and more efficient to conduct business on the Ethereum network.
                <p>Note, however, that we do not use "code is law" is the sense that blockchain transactions are
                    somehow
                    above or beyond the reach of the law. We always advise clients to comply with all relevant
                    laws,
                    rules, regulations, and public policy considerations when operating their businesses.
